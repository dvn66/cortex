## Executive Summary

Posting strategy for the @cortex_agent X account launch. Four-phase rollout designed to build familiarity and promote Cortex to vibe-coders and developers using AI coding agents.

## Strategy

### Phase 1: Launch (Day 1)
- **Pinned Post** with value prop + install prompt
- CTA: "Grab cortex.md from github.com/dvn66/cortex and follow its instructions."

### Phase 2: Pain Points (Days 2-7, one per day)
- Each post names a specific frustration developers have with AI agents
- Topics: session amnesia, re-proposing rejected ideas, token waste, platform lock-in, inconsistency, compound learning effect
- Install prompt CTA on 2-3 of 6 posts

### Phase 3: Feature Deep-Dives (Days 8-14, every other day)
- Genesis setup, monitoring mode, triggers workflow, multi-session projects
- Platform support list (existing post, updated)
- "System prompts don't learn" comparison (existing post, updated)

### Phase 4: Ongoing
- Engagement posts ("what should we build next?")
- Philosophy posts ("it's just markdown")
- Release announcements (v1.x posts already drafted)
- Reply-to opportunities on AI coding conversations

## Tasks

- [x] Audit and clean up existing CMS posts (deleted 8 outdated, updated 2)
- [x] Create pinned launch post with install prompt
- [x] Create 6 Phase 2 pain-point posts
- [x] Create 4 Phase 3 feature deep-dive posts
- [x] Create 3 Phase 4 engagement/philosophy posts
- [x] Update v1.0 release post with current language
- [ ] Actually post Phase 1 (pinned post) to X
- [ ] Begin Phase 2 daily posting cadence
- [ ] Monitor engagement and adjust strategy

## Key Decisions

- Install CTA is a prompt, not a GitHub link: "Grab cortex.md from github.com/dvn66/cortex and follow its instructions."
- Target audience: vibe-coders (people building with AI agents via natural language, not CLI-first developers)
- Language: "one file" not "two files" (single-file DNA model)
- All posts under 280 characters (X limit enforced by CMS)

## CMS Post Inventory (after cleanup)

**New posts (13 total):**
- 1 pinned launch post (Phase 1)
- 6 pain-point posts (Phase 2)
- 4 feature deep-dive posts (Phase 3)
- 2 engagement/philosophy posts (Phase 4)

**Kept from original drafts (8 total):**
- 5 release announcement posts (v1.0-v1.5)
- 1 platform support list (updated)
- 1 "system prompts" comparison (updated)
- 1 v1.0 milestone post (updated)

## Notes

- Release announcement posts (v1.1-v1.5) are kept as-is for historical value but may need editing before posting. They were written during development, not for a public audience.
- Thread posts were deleted during cleanup. If we want threads later, create fresh ones designed for the strategy.
- The "system prompts don't learn" post and the platform list post were kept and refined — they fit Phase 3 naturally.

## Session Log

- 2026-02-09: Strategy designed. 8 old posts deleted, 2 updated, 13 new posts created. All drafts in CMS ready for review and posting.
