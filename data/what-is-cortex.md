# What is Cortex?

Cortex is a collaborative memory system between a human and an AI agent.

It solves three problems:
1. AI agents lose all context between sessions. Cortex gives them persistent memory.
2. Projects accumulate hard-won knowledge (principles, patterns, lessons) that gets lost. Cortex captures and organizes it.
3. There's no protocol for when and how an agent should refresh its memory. Cortex defines explicit triggers.

## How It Works

The system has two layers:
- **DNA** (cortex.md + README.md) — The portable core. Contains all trigger definitions, prompts, protocols, and behavioral rules. Carry these two files to any project.
- **Data layer** (data/) — The memories. Diary entries, principles, vision, active memory, lessons learned. Generated by genesis, unique to each project.

## Triggers

Type ::? to see all available triggers. Type ::boot to start.

## Design Philosophy

- Human-readable files, not opaque embeddings
- Collaborative — both human and agent contribute
- Explicit protocols over implicit hope
- Append-only principles, living memory
- The system reproduces itself via ::genesis
