# Cortex v1.3.0

**Date:** 2026-02-08

## Summary

Cortex v1.3.0 adds optional Deep Seeding to the genesis protocol — a new phase (3b) that reads discovered project documentation and suggests initial principles, vocabulary, and lessons to jumpstart a fresh Cortex install. Phase 3 scan is upgraded to enumerate knowledge sources by name. Three new vocabulary terms added.

## Added

- **Deep Seeding phase (3b)** — Optional genesis phase inserted between Consent-to-Scan (Phase 3) and Self-Test (Phase 4). Reads discovered docs, PRDs, READMEs, architecture files, and code conventions. Drafts grouped suggestions (candidate goals, constraints, best practices, vocabulary, lessons). Presents all for user approval before writing anything. Items tagged `[genesis-seeded]` for traceability.
- **Separate permission gate for Deep Seeding** — Phase 3 consent does not carry over. Deep Seeding requires its own explicit "yes" before the agent reads any content.
- **Knowledge source enumeration in Phase 3** — Consent-to-Scan now enumerates each discoverable document by name and location (docs, PRDs, ADRs, READMEs, code conventions). List is written to active memory and feeds the Deep Seeding offer.
- **Vocabulary: Deep Seeding** — Definition of the optional genesis phase and its permission model.
- **Vocabulary: diary consolidation** — Definition of the 60-day diary compression protocol.
- **Vocabulary: genesis-seeded** — Definition of the provenance tag for Deep Seeding items.

## Changed

- **Genesis vocabulary entry** — Updated to reflect "five phases plus optional Deep Seeding" instead of just "five phases."
- **Phase 3 scan scope** — Expanded to explicitly include ADRs, error handling patterns, naming conventions, and testing patterns in addition to the original scan targets.

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. Existing v1.2.0 installations can upgrade by replacing cortex.md. Deep Seeding is entirely optional — genesis will skip Phase 3b if no knowledge sources are found or if the user declines. No new files or directories are required. The three new vocabulary terms are install-specific and do not travel with the DNA.
