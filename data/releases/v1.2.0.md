# Cortex v1.2.0

**Date:** 2026-02-08

## Summary

Cortex v1.2.0 introduces diary consolidation — a structured protocol for managing diary volume over time. After 60 days, monthly diary entries are eligible for consolidation into compressed summaries, with originals archived (never deleted) and human approval required before any action. The vocabulary file gets its first population, and the Memory Aging Protocol is restructured for clarity.

## Added

- **Diary consolidation protocol** — New subsection in Memory Aging Protocol. Rules: 60-day threshold, monthly summary generation (300-800 words), originals archived to `data/archive/diary/`, human-in-the-loop approval required, idempotent (won't re-process months that already have summaries).
- **Diary consolidation check in `memory-maintenance`** — At session end, the agent now scans `data/diary/` for calendar months eligible for consolidation and prompts the user if candidates are found.
- **Vocabulary populated** — 17 Cortex terms (DNA, data layer, CORTEX_ROOT, genesis, boot, monitoring mode, bootstrap, trigger, RAM, disk, working set, memory aging, shepherd behavior, append-only, atomic writes, round-trip fidelity, local triggers, CoVe), 8 project terms (X CMS, DNA Editor, two-pillar system, cortex-parser, cortex-writer, interface contract registry, phase-gated implementation, seam failure), 16 shorthand entries (all trigger codes).

## Changed

- **Memory Aging Protocol** — Restructured into two subsections: "Active Memory Aging" (existing rules, unchanged) and "Diary Consolidation" (new). Clarified that principles are permanent and never subject to aging or consolidation.

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. Existing v1.1.0 installations can upgrade by replacing cortex.md. The diary consolidation protocol is passive — it only activates when the `memory-maintenance` trigger runs at session end and finds eligible months. No new directories or files are required until consolidation actually occurs. The vocabulary file population is install-specific and does not travel with the DNA.
