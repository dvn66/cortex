# Cortex v1.1.0

**Date:** 2026-02-08

## Summary

Cortex v1.1.0 introduces the local triggers system — an extension mechanism for install-specific workflows that don't travel with the DNA. The `::proj` trigger gets a major upgrade with an interview-driven creation flow and template composition. The first local trigger, `::release`, provides a structured release ceremony. Lessons.md gets its first entries, establishing the long-term memory layer.

## Added

- **Local triggers system** — Install-specific triggers that live in `data/triggers/local.md`, loaded at boot, never ported with the DNA. Rules: additive only, same format as DNA triggers, conflict detection against DNA trigger codes at boot.
- **`::release` local trigger** — Multi-step release workflow: version bump (semver), changelog scan, release notes generation, vision document review.
- **`::releases` local trigger** — Lists all releases with version, date, and summary.
- **`::proj` interview flow** — 3 quick-pick questions (type, size, tracking) plus 1 optional free-text, completing in under 30 seconds.
- **Template composition system** — 5 project types (Feature Build, Testing, Research, Refactor, Other) assembled from 10 reusable template blocks in `data/templates/`.
- **`::proj` dashboard** — No-payload `::proj` shows all projects grouped by Active, Dormant, Completed with task progress.
- **Quick-create shortcut** — Small obvious tasks skip the interview and create lightweight projects automatically.
- **Tiered project reporting** — `::ss` and `::se` now report tracked projects verbosely, untracked projects quietly, and dormant projects with a nudge.
- **`data/templates/` directory** — 10 template block files for project document assembly.
- **First lessons captured** — Chain of Verification (CoVe) technique and auto-session-end gap documented in `lessons.md`.

## Changed

- **`::nt` trigger** — Now supports `local` type, writing to `data/triggers/local.md` instead of cortex.md.
- **`::nt?` help** — Updated to list `local` as a valid trigger type.
- **Genesis protocol** — Now creates `data/triggers/` directory and seeds `local.md` with a header comment.
- **Directory structure diagram** — Updated in cortex.md to include `data/triggers/local.md`.
- **`::ss` trigger** — Now includes tiered project status reporting (tracked/untracked/dormant).
- **`::se` trigger** — Now includes project update step with real-time task updates and session log entries.

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. Existing v1.0.0 installations can upgrade by replacing cortex.md. Genesis does not need to be re-run — the new `data/triggers/` directory and `data/templates/` directory will be created on first use of `::nt local` or `::proj` respectively. To get the full template system immediately, run genesis in a fresh project or manually create the directories and seed files.
