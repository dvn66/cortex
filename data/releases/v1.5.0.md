# Cortex v1.5.0

**Date:** 2026-02-09

## Summary

Cortex v1.5.0 adds self-update capability. The new `::update` trigger checks GitHub for newer versions of cortex.md, shows what changed (pulling official release notes from GitHub Releases), asks for confirmation, and replaces the DNA file — never touching the data layer. Boot now includes an optional version check that notifies users when an update is available.

## Added

- **`::update` trigger** — Fetches the latest cortex.md from GitHub, compares versions via semver, pulls release notes from the GitHub Releases API, shows current version / new version / full changelog, asks for explicit confirmation before replacing. Safety rules enforce that the `data/` directory is never modified during an update.
- **Multi-version changelog** — When multiple versions have been skipped, `::update` fetches and displays release notes for each intermediate version in order.
- **Boot version check** — `::boot` now optionally fetches line 1 of the remote cortex.md to compare versions. If a newer version exists, the boot output includes: `Update available: vX.Y.Z -> vA.B.C — run ::update`. Fails silently if the fetch is unsupported or unreachable.
- **`::update` in README trigger table** — Added to the Triggers at a Glance section.

## Changed

- **Boot output format** — Added optional version check line to the boot response template (after monitoring status, before "Type ::? for trigger list").

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. Existing v1.4.0 installations can upgrade by replacing cortex.md. The `::update` trigger is self-contained — it requires no data layer changes and works immediately after replacing the DNA file. The boot version check is optional and fails silently on platforms that don't support URL fetching.
