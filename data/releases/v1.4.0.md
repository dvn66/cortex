# Cortex v1.4.0

**Date:** 2026-02-09

## Summary

Cortex v1.4.0 hardens the boot sequence with verified monitoring and finalizes the single-file DNA model. The `::boot` trigger now confirms that all data layer files were successfully read before reporting "active" — using a passphrase that can only appear if cortex.md was actually loaded. Platform compatibility criteria are documented, onboarding paths are finalized, and project identity now lives in the data layer.

## Added

- **Boot verification with passphrase** — `::boot` defaults monitoring status to `failed`. Only reports `Monitoring: active — context will survive` after successfully reading active.md, lessons.md, and vocabulary.md. If any read fails: `Monitoring: failed — re-run ::boot`.
- **lessons.md in boot read list** — `::boot` now explicitly reads `data/memory/lessons.md` (was previously omitted from the read sequence).
- **Project identity in active.md** — X handle (@cortex_agent), GitHub repo (dvn66/cortex), raw URL, and one-liner fetch command now live in the data layer, accessible to any booted Cortex instance.
- **Two onboarding paths finalized** — (1) Download/upload cortex.md, (2) paste one-liner that fetches from GitHub raw URL. Both documented in README.md.
- **Platform compatibility criterion** — Must have persistent project filesystem across sessions. Supported: Replit, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Base44.

## Changed

- **Single-file DNA model** — cortex.md is the only portable file. README.md serves as the GitHub repo landing page but is not part of the portable DNA. All references updated (vocabulary, vision, README).
- **Vision document** — Updated bio and design principles to reflect single-file model ("one file" instead of "two files").

## Removed

- **ChatGPT as supported platform** — Ruled out due to lack of persistent filesystem across sessions. Cortex cannot deliver its core value on stateless platforms.

## Migration Notes

No breaking changes. Existing v1.3.0 installations can upgrade by replacing cortex.md. The boot verification is backward-compatible — if data layer files exist from a prior genesis, the new boot will read them and report success. The passphrase is embedded in the DNA and requires no user action.
