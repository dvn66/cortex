# Cortex Public Presence: Why It Exists

## Branding

- **X account:** @cortex_agent
- **Tagline:** Memory that survives the session.
- **Bio (confirmed):** Persistent memory for AI coding agents. Two files, zero dependencies, human-readable. Open source.
- **Display name:** Cortex (pending confirmation)

## The Problem
Cortex is a powerful memory system for AI coding agents, but it currently lives only as a GitHub repository. There's no public-facing presence — no website, no landing page, no way for potential users to discover what Cortex is, understand its value, or get started without first navigating a raw repo. The project needs a front door.

## What This Project Is
This project manages the public presence of Cortex — the website, documentation, and any public-facing materials that help people discover, understand, and adopt the Cortex memory system. It's the bridge between the raw GitHub repo and the wider developer audience who could benefit from persistent AI agent memory.

## What It Provides
- A public-facing representation of the Cortex project
- Clear communication of what Cortex does and why it matters
- An accessible entry point for new users
- A managed, polished presence that reflects the quality of the underlying system

## Design Principles
- The public presence should be as clean and minimal as Cortex itself — two files, zero dependencies
- Substance over flash — developers trust clear documentation more than marketing
- The site should embody the same philosophy as Cortex: human-readable, explicit, no unnecessary complexity
- Everything shown should be accurate to the current state of the project

## Who It's For
Developers working with AI coding agents who are frustrated by session amnesia — the audience who would benefit most from discovering Cortex.
