- **Communication style (2026-02-07):** Detailed. Thorough explanations preferred over terse answers.
- **Monitoring mode (2026-02-07):** Active. Capture principles, patterns, vocabulary, and lessons automatically as they emerge in conversation. No need to wait for explicit triggers.
- **Cortex data portability (2026-02-07):** Markdown files are always the source of truth for Cortex DNA. No database should store cortex data — the files must remain portable. Any editor or tool is a lens over the files, not a replacement.
