# Birth Story

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Platform:** Replit
**CORTEX_ROOT:** cortex/

Cortex was born in a fresh Replit fullstack TypeScript project. The user's GitHub repository (dvn66/cortex) was connected via Replit's GitHub integration, and the DNA files were pulled directly into the `cortex/` directory.

Genesis ran all five phases:
1. **Confirm & Create** — Data layer directories and seed files created. Bootstrap written to replit.md.
2. **Interview** — Project purpose captured (persistent memory for AI coding agents). Communication style: concise. Monitoring: active.
3. **Consent-to-Scan** — Project scanned. Found a blank TypeScript fullstack starter (React + Vite + Express + Drizzle/PostgreSQL) with Shadcn UI. No custom code yet.
4. **Self-Test** — All 4 checks passed: file I/O, principle capture, boot sequence, bootstrap integrity.
5. **First Diary** — Birth entry written to data/diary/2026/02/07.md.

The system is live and monitoring.
