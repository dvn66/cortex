## Summary

Two releases shipped today: v1.4.0 and v1.5.0. Both were developed, released, and drafted for X — though the v1.5.0 GitHub push is blocked by temporary rate limiting from the v1.4.0 push.

### Session 1 — v1.4.0: Boot Verification

The session opened with the v1.4.0 release, which added boot verification to the `::boot` trigger. When an agent boots Cortex, it now reads the data layer files (active.md, lessons.md, vocabulary.md) and proves it by echoing the passphrase "context will survive" — a phrase that only exists in active.md. If the agent says the passphrase, you know it actually loaded the files, not just acknowledged the instruction.

Other v1.4.0 changes:
- `lessons.md` added to the boot sequence (previously only active.md was read at boot)
- Project identity (X handle, GitHub repo, raw URL) moved from hardcoded server code into active.md — now any booted Cortex instance has it immediately
- Single-file DNA model finalized: cortex.md is the only portable file, README.md is the repo landing page
- ChatGPT formally ruled out as a supported platform (stateless filesystem)

v1.4.0 was pushed to GitHub successfully (commit + Release object created). X post drafted via CMS API.

### Session 2 — v1.5.0: Self-Updating DNA

Built the `::update` trigger — the first trigger that reaches out to the network. When a user says `::update`, the agent:

1. Reads the current version from the local cortex.md
2. Fetches the latest version from GitHub (raw URL)
3. Compares versions
4. If an update is available: fetches release notes from the GitHub Releases API, shows current vs. new version and what changed, asks for explicit confirmation before replacing
5. If the user confirms: replaces cortex.md (data/ directory is NEVER touched), confirms success
6. If versions match: reports "already up to date"

Safety rules baked into the trigger:
- Never modify the data/ directory during updates (that's the user's memory)
- Always show changelog before replacing
- Always get explicit confirmation
- Support multi-version skipped updates by enumerating intermediate releases

Boot was also enhanced: the `::boot` output now includes an optional version check — the agent can note if a newer version is available when booting.

v1.5.0 GitHub push is pending — all write endpoints returning 429 after the v1.4.0 push. Files are ready locally; just needs the rate limit to clear.

README.md updated with `::update` in the trigger table.

X post drafted for v1.5.0 via CMS API.

### Session 3 — Memory Drift Discussion

The session ended with a discussion about whether Cortex's connection to the agent can "drift" or be forgotten across sessions. The answer: yes, it can, but Cortex has layered defenses:

1. **`::boot` trigger** — defined in the platform's config file (replit.md, .cursorrules, etc.), read automatically at session start
2. **Passphrase verification** — proves the agent actually read the data layer
3. **Bootstrap block in replit.md** — failsafe "EXECUTE NOW" instruction catches agents that skip boot

Vulnerabilities acknowledged: mid-session context loss in very long sessions, agents that ignore instructions, someone deleting the bootstrap block. No new safeguards added — the existing layers are solid for now.

### What was discovered

- GitHub rate limiting is aggressive on write endpoints — multiple pushes in quick succession trigger 429s that persist for several minutes
- The `::update` trigger is the first "networked" trigger — all previous triggers operate purely on local files
- Multi-version changelog display requires the GitHub Releases API, not just comparing version strings

### Decisions made

- `::update` safety: data/ directory is explicitly protected during updates
- Boot version check is optional, not blocking — the agent mentions it but doesn't force an update
- No new anti-drift safeguards added — existing boot sequence is sufficient for now
