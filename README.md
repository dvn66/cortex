# Cortex

A collaborative memory system between you and your AI agent. Persistent across sessions.

## Quick Start

1. Drop `cortex.md` and this `README.md` anywhere in your project.
2. Tell your agent: "Read and act on `[path-to]/cortex.md`"
3. Type `::genesis` to birth Cortex. It auto-detects where it landed and builds everything else.

## After Genesis

- `::boot` — Load the system
- `::ss` — Start a session (full briefing)
- `::se` — End a session (write diary, update memory)
- `::?` — List all triggers

Read `cortex.md` for the full system definition.
